It extends pyhook to have normal hotkey functionality like autohotkey (AHK) scripts.

* Option to run trigger function in thread
* Option to run trigger function on a key up event

PYHK is as simple as this:

```python
import pyhk
 
def fun():
    print "Do something"
 
#create pyhk class instance
hot = pyhk.pyhk()
 
#add hotkey
hot.addHotkey(['Ctrl', 'Alt','7'],fun)
 
#start looking for hotkey.
hot.start()
```

##Known Issues

Python IDLE freezes at times. Best use is to call your script directly from the command line with python YOURSCRIPT.py.

After logout or sleep on some machines the hotkeys get triggered by only pressing the modifiers.
